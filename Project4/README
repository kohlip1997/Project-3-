It's a todo application where you can list the things you need to do. 
To achieve this, we will create a Docker compose file to set up two containersâ€”one for the application and the other for the database
We have two containers:

Application: Running on port 3000.
MongoDB: Running on port 27017."

How to Run the Application:

1- Get your public IP for EC2.
2- Access the application using the following URL format: http://[server IP]:3000.
	Replace [server IP] with your actual public IP address. For example: http://123.45.67.89:3000

To list all continer runnning 
1- docker ps
